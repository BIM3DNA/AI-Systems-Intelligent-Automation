# AI Systems & Intelligent Automation

This repository contains a pyRevit-delivered AI workbench with one Revit entry point and one window.

## Current Product Surfaces

- `Ollama Chat`: low-risk conversational help and prompt experimentation
- `ModelMind`: primary workflow for deterministic and semi-generative BIM task recipes
- `AI Agent`: advanced reviewed planning/execution surface with destructive tools disabled by default

## Key Implementation Artifacts

- `AI.extension/AI.tab/Dev.panel/AI_01.pushbutton/script.py`
- `AI.extension/AI.tab/Dev.panel/AI_01.pushbutton/UI.xaml`
- `AI.extension/lib/prompt_catalog.json`
- `AI.extension/lib/approved_recipes.json`
- `AI.extension/lib/ai_prompt_registry.py`
- `AI.extension/lib/ai_local_store.py`
- `AI.extension/lib/ai_agent_session.py`
- `AI.extension/lib/ai_reviewed_code.py`

## Current Validation Position

The earlier migration baseline was runtime-validated in pyRevit at UI-launch level. Current live findings additionally confirm theme persistence, Ollama Chat, and deterministic ModelMind tasks. The reviewed-code hardening patch is implemented, but its new blocking/save-flow behavior still requires live post-patch validation in pyRevit/Revit.
